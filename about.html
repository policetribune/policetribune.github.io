Originally, the purpose of the association was to provide scholarship to the deserving orphaned children of the police but in 2002, it expanded its services as a foundation to the sad flight of indigenous families and their children in the informal settlements (squatters) of Metro Manila. It provides emergency assistance to the families and medical and dental services, scholarship to deserving elementary, high school and college students in the districts of San Miguel, Malate, Paco, Tondo and some from Navotas and Quezon City. Currently, the foundation have thirty nine (39) scholars being served in these areas and intend to reach out for more in the future years.</p>
